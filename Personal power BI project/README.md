# 🧠 Diabetes Risk Analytics Dashboard - Power BI Project

## 📊 Overview
This is a personal Power BI project built to explore, analyze, and visualize healthcare data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
The dashboard provides actionable insights into patient health metrics and diabetes risk levels based on glucose and BMI indicators.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze and visualize trends in BMI, glucose levels, and other patient data
- Identify patients at high, medium, and low risk of diabetes
- Build an interactive dashboard with slicers and filters
- Apply DAX to calculate risk classification and custom metrics
- Enhance usability through clean layout and reset functionality
