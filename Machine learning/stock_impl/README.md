                                                 Predict Volatility of Stock

You are provided with monthly and quaterly  historical stock data. The task is to predict the volatility of a stock in November 2023 when given historical data from January 2022 to October 2023 for 613 stocks.

Programming environment  Python 3.9.12;

Versions of packages used : 

Numpy version: 1.26.4
Pandas version: 2.1.4
Seaborn version: 0.13.1

Steps to Run Final Model : The ipynb file is divided into the following sections 

1.Data Pre Processing 
2.Exploratory Data Analysis 
3.Feature Engineering
4.Data Transformation 
5.Feature Selection
6.Lagged Feature 
7.Model Tuning 
8.Model Training 

In order to train model and generate predictions you can run the sections from Step 1 to Step 6 and then run the code under Step 8.

Model Tuning involves Hyper-parameter tuning with Cross Validation and can take sometime to run , to avoid a long wait time you skip the code block under this step 7 only.

All other code blocks have to run in order to generate predictions accurately.
