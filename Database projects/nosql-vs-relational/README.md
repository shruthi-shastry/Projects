# 🔀 Relational vs. Non-Relational Database Queries – Monash New Smile 

This project contrasts **relational (Oracle SQL & relational algebra)** and **non-relational (MongoDB)** query approaches for a healthcare database case study.
Developed for **FIT9132: Introduction to Databases**, the task demonstrates advanced querying, JSON document generation, and real-world data modeling.

---

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives

- ✅ Apply the theories of the **relational database model**
- ✅ Manage data via **SQL queries** and **transactions**
- ✅ Compare **NoSQL models** (MongoDB) with traditional RDBMS
- ✅ Practice writing **relational algebra**, SQL, and MongoDB commands

## 🧠 Case Study: Monash New Smile (MNS)

Monash New Smile is a dental services provider. The project models:
- Patients, emergency contacts, providers, nurses
- Appointments, services, service-items
- Charges, follow-ups, and room management

## 🧪 Key Features

### 📘 Task 1 – Relational Algebra
- Write symbolic RA expressions for:
  - Items never used
  - Patients from specific cities and dates
  - Patients attended by endodontists

### 🧾 Task 2 – Oracle SQL Queries
- Complex joins, aggregation, ordering, and formatting
- Appointment-level total cost calculations
- Provider productivity and usage summaries
- Fee differential analysis
- Patient appointment percentage (follow-up ratio)
- Output formatted to match system requirements

### 🌐 Task 3 – MongoDB NoSQL
- JSON document generation from RDBMS tables
- Insert documents into MongoDB collection
- Filtering documents using compound conditions
- Update nested array fields (e.g., item description)
- Push additional documents into existing arrays

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Oracle RDBMS (SQL Developer)
- Relational Algebra (symbolic notation)
- MongoDB (shell + `.js` scripting)
- JSON Schema Design
- Git for version control (Monash GitLab)
