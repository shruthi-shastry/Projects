# 🐾 Pets First – Conceptual & Logical Database Design

This project represents a complete **conceptual and logical database design** for a veterinary practice system called **Pets First**, 
developed as part of **Introduction to Databases** at Monash University.

It spans a case study was progressively developed from entity-relationship modeling to Oracle schema creation and normalization.

## 📋 Assignment Objectives

**Assignment 1A (Conceptual Design):**
- Apply theories of the relational model to analyze a case study
- Identify entities, attributes, and relationships
- Develop a full ER diagram using crow’s foot notation

**Assignment 1B (Logical Design & Implementation):**
- Normalize documents to 3NF with complete dependency analysis
- Translate conceptual design to a logical model using Oracle Data Modeler
- Generate schema SQL and test creation in Oracle DB
- Document assumptions and submit a data dictionary

## 🧠 Case Study Summary: Pets First (PF)

The system supports a chain of veterinary clinics. It includes:
- Clinics, vets (including specialists), training, and appointments
- Pet owners and their animals
- Services, drugs, invoices, and visit histories
- Relationships like follow-up visits and vet training at different clinics
