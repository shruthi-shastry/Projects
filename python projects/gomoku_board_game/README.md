# 🎮 Gomoku Board Game – Python

This project implements a simplified **Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row)** board game in Python.
Built as part of **Algorithms and Programming Foundations**, this terminal-based application demonstrates control flow, function design, and data structures in Python.

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives

-  Apply best practice Python programming constructs for solving computational problems
- Practice functional decomposition, testing, and user interaction via a menu-driven interface
- Develop logic for a competitive two-player game, including a basic AI opponent

---

## 🧩 Game Overview

**Gomoku** is a two-player board game where players alternate placing stones on a square grid. The first to align five of their stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. The game ends when:
- A player aligns five stones in a row (win), or
- The board is full without a winner (draw)

## 🛠 Features

- 🧭 **Interactive text-based game menu**
  - Start game (vs. player or computer)
  - Place stone
  - Print board
  - Reset
  - Exit

- 📐 **Board sizes:** 9x9, 13x13, or 15x15
- 🔁 **Turns alternate** with black (`●`) and white (`○`) stones
- 🤖 **Basic AI**: Random move near player’s last move
- ✅ Win/draw detection
- ❌ Invalid move prevention and error messages

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- PEP8 styling and function docstrings
- Built-in libraries only (as per assignment: `random`)
