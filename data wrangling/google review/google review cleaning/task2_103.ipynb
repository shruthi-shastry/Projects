        "1. We used NLTK's collocation finder to identify the top 200 bigrams based on PMI.\n",
        "2. These bigrams were then used to create a Multi-Word Expression (MWE) tokenizer.\n",

        "This approach allows us to capture meaningful two-word phrases while still maintaining individual words,\n",
        "providing a richer representation of the language used in the reviews.\n",

        "The resulting vocabulary gives us insight into the most common and important terms used across all reviews,\n",

        "   - Tokens with less than 3 characters are removed as they are often not meaningful on their own.\n",
